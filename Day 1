LINUX:

	-GRUB ->
		It is a bootloader
		Selects the kernel(os)

	-Kernel interacts with the hardware(like a translator) => device drivers.

	-In linux, everything is treated as a file system

	-difference between process and job.
		process:
			program in execution
			instance of the running program
			has its own PID.
		JOB:
			individual or shell commands
			has its own jobID

	-notebook LM(AI)

	-LINUX PROCESS ID - 1
		INIT Process will gets loaded

	-INIT PROCESS 
		Services(each and every separate functionality) and system configuration.

	-Boot process

	-Device Drivers	 
		It is the translator between the hardware and the kernel.

	-process scheduling
		- how to see or set the priority of the process
			By changing the nice value.

		- debugging in the priority related issues:
			use top command to check the priority and to check the cpu live usage.
			check whether any process takes high cpu but it takes lower priority.
			For debugging real-time process "chrt -p <PID>" command.

		- nice value
			-20(high priority) to +19(lowest priority)
			0 => default
			less nice value=>high priority, high nice value => less priority

		- how to determine the execution time for each process(is there any algorithms etc....).
			Time command is used to determine the execution time of each process
			In LINUX the default scheduling technique is CFS.
			CFS user vruntime to determine which process to go next.
		
	-memory management
		- Aspects that need to be considered in Memory management.
			Allocation and deallocation of memory when required and not required, protection, sharing etc...

		- paging
			It is the memory management technique.
			Memory is divided into fixed size blocks that are pages(virtual memory) and page frames(physical memory).
			Each page is mapped to the page frame in the page table.
			The size of pages in all bits os is 4KB only. The page size and the system size is not related.

		- what happens while loading the data from the rom to ram.
			rom => non-volatile memory
			ram => volatile memory
			while loading data from rom to ram it will be done faster.

		- what is 64-bit os or 32-bit os . Is it a page size?
			No, the page size and the is bit is not even related to each other.

		- general page size 4kb's then what is 64-bit 32 bit?
			Both the system used 4KB page size.
			It says the CPU and os of larger address space. 

		- segmentation. did segmentation and paging are related?

			| Feature          | Segmentation                | Paging                        |
			| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
			| Division type    | Logical (code, data, stack) | Fixed-size pages (e.g., 4 KB) |
			| Size             | Variable                    | Fixed                         |
			| Fragmentation    | External fragmentation      | Internal fragmentation        |
			| Address format   | Segment + Offset            | Page number + Offset          |
			| Access check     | Against segment limit       | Access rights per page        |
			| Use in modern OS | Rarely used alone           | Widely used                   |

			-In external fragmentation to overcome the unavailability of contiguous space in the memory some techniques can be used like best-fit, first-fit etc...
			-Internal Fragmentation is has the pages of fixed size(4KB).

	-Virtual File system
		File system:
			A file system is the software method or data structure that defines how files and directories are arranged, stored, named, accessed, and managed on a storage device 			(like HDD, SSD, USB, etc.).

		VFS is the translator or abstraction layer between the file system and the user space. That is when the user requests the file , the file will be given to the user but the 	file system in the file presents is hidden.
		once the user sends the request for a file to the system, then
			1. sending the request open("/home/sanjuga/report.pdf")
			2. The VFS receives the request, but it don't care whatever the file extension can be.
			3. The vfs first breaks down the path, like 
				/		=> root directory
				home/		=> user directory
				Sanjuga/	=> my folder
				report.pdf	=> my requested file
			4. Now VFS checks on which file system does the file was. It was on the /home => xfs
			5. Now it asks the ext4 file system to fetch that file.

			Folders created by us don't have its own file system. /home, /, /mnt/usb has its own file system types.
